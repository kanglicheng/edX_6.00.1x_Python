    "Encryption is the process of obscuring information to make it unreadable without special knowledge. For centuries, people have devised schemes to encrypt messages - some better than others - but the advent of the computer and the Internet revolutionized the field. These days, it's hard not to encounter some sort of encryption, whether you are buying something online or logging into a shared computer system. Encryption lets you share information with other trusted people, without fear of disclosure.\n",
    "\n",
    "A cipher is an algorithm for performing encryption (and the reverse, decryption). The original information is called plaintext. After it is encrypted, it is called ciphertext. The ciphertext message contains all the information of the plaintext message, but it is not in a format readable by a human or computer without the proper mechanism to decrypt it; it should resemble random gibberish to those for whom it is not intended.\n",
    "\n",
    "A cipher usually depends on a piece of auxiliary information, called a key. The key is incorporated into the encryption process; the same plaintext encrypted with two different keys should have two different ciphertexts. Without the key, it should be difficult to decrypt the resulting ciphertext into readable plaintext.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment will deal with a well-known (though not very secure) encryption method called the Caesar cipher. Some vocabulary to get you started on this problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Encryption - the process of obscuring or encoding messages to make them unreadable until they are decrypted\n",
    "• Decryption - making encrypted messages readable again by decoding them\n",
    "• Cipher - algorithm for performing encryption and decryption\n",
    "• Plaintext - the original message\n",
    "• Ciphertext - the encrypted message. Note: a ciphertext still contains all of the original message information, even if it looks like gibberish.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Caesar Cipher:\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of the Caesar Cipher is to pick an integer and shift every letter of your message by that integer. In other words, suppose the shift is k . Then, all instances of the i-th letter of the alphabet that appear in the plaintext should become the (i+k)-th letter of the alphabet in the ciphertext. You will need to be careful with the case in which i + k > 26 (the length of the alphabet). Here is what the whole alphabet looks like shifted three spots to the right:\n",
    "\n",
    "Original:  a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z\n",
    " 3-shift:  d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z a b c\n",
    " \n",
    "Using the above key, we can quickly translate the message \"happy\" to \"kdssb\" (note how the 3-shifted alphabet wraps around at the end, so x -> a, y -> b, and z -> c).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note!! We are using the English alphabet for this problem - that is, the following letters in the following order:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> import string\n",
    ">>> print string.ascii_lowercase\n",
    "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\n",
    "\n",
    "We will treat uppercase and lowercase letters individually, so that uppercase letters are always mapped to an uppercase letter, and lowercase letters are always mapped to a lowercase letter. If an uppercase letter maps to \"A\", then the same lowercase letter should map to \"a\". Punctuation and spaces should be retained and not changed. For example, a plaintext message with a comma should have a corresponding ciphertext with a comma in the same position.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "|    plaintext    |  shift    |  ciphertext      |\n",

    "We implemented for you two helper functions: load_words and is_word. You may use these in your solution and you do not need to understand them completely, but should read the associated comments. You should read and understand the helper code in the rest of the file and use it to guide your solutions.\n",

    "1. Fill in the build_shift_dict(self, shift) method of the Message class. Be sure that your dictionary includes both lower and upper case letters, but that the shifted character for a lower case letter and its uppercase version are lower and upper case instances of the same letter. What this means is that if the original letter is \"a\" and its shifted value is \"c\", the letter \"A\" should shift to the letter \"C\".\n",
    "\n",

    "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\n",
    ">>> print(string.ascii_uppercase)\n",
    "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\n",
    "\n",
    "A reminder from the introduction page - characters such as the space character, commas, periods, exclamation points, etc will not be encrypted by this cipher - basically, all the characters within string.punctuation, plus the space (' ') and all numerical characters (0 - 9) found in string.digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Fill in the apply_shift(self, shift) method of the Message class. You may find it easier to use build_shift_dict(self, shift). Remember that spaces and punctuation should not be changed by the cipher."
