Handy Tips for Python from 6.001x:

• print("print a variable's value: {0}, and another one: {1}".format(variable1, variable2))

• Assert statements: raise an error unless something is true

• Split and join methods on strings, helpful for when you know the general format of the string.

• Generators: define a function and put <yield> statement(s) inside. Multiple "returns" made possible!
